# Noise and Covariance Matrices

Cancel noises in audio inputs by estimating the covariance matrices. See compiled code here:https://jingjingguo1.github.io/Gradient-Descent-Algorithm-Audio-Filtering/view/GradientDescent_AudioFiltering.html

Original audios is available in the *old_audios* folder and the filtered audios are in the *new_audios* folder.
